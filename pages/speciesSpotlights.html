                <p>Bubble coral, or Plerogyra sinuosa are one of the most intriguing types of coral reef species. Commonly found in sheltered areas at depths of 3-35 meters, the bubble coral is often mistaken for fish eggs.

                    During the day, these white/skin coloured polyps resemble bubbles or even a bunch of grapes, but at night the little balloons deflate, allowing for their tentacles to protract and hunt for food.
                    
                    Bubble corals can be found in coral reef locations such as the Red Sea and Indian Ocean to the mid-Pacific.

                <p>Sun corals, or Tubastaea thrive in coral reef locations across the Red Sea, Indo-Pacific, Western Indian Ocean and the Southern Pacific. They usually live underneath dark overhangs and inside caves where there are nutrient-rich waters and strong currents.

                    During feeding, the tentacles of this coral will extend from their tubular base and fully open, ready to receive plankton.
                    
                    These cheerful organisms can be found in an array of bright colours ranging from shades of yellow, orange, red and pink.

                <p>The grooved brain coral received its common name from its remarkably similar appearance to a human brain. Its deep grooves and intricate folding patterns also resemble that of a maze or labyrinth, contributing to its scientific name, Diploria labryinthiformis.

Although this species of reef-building coral appear to be very large, only the outer few millimeters represent living tissue. Grooved brain coral structures only grow a few millimeters each year and many large corals will be hundreds of years old.

This species needs to be at depths where light can penetrate the water, and therefore is most commonly found on reefs at depths between 1 and 30 meters. At these depths the grooved brain coral is often colored brown or yellow. However, in deeper waters, it can have a grayish appearance.

                <p>Branched finger coral is known to be one of the oldest forms of life on earth due to the slow growth rate of the coral. Many scientist believe that some corals of this species are up to 1,000 years old. Generally found on shallow to mid-slope reef environments, they can also be found among seagrass and on the roots of mangroves.

                    The common name was received from their appearance. Short, slender lobes/branches with rounded tips, often densely packed together, give the impression of human fingers. The colour of this coral is yellow or grey-brown and the interior parts of the coral often have a purplish tinge.
                    
                    Branched finger coral, Porites furcata, can be distinguished from other members of the genus 'Porites' with a more uniform lobe size and rounded bulbous lobe tips. The lobes grow to a diameter of up to 0.4 to 0.8 in (1 to 2 cm).

                <p>One of the most colorful of the clown-hosting anemones. Saddle carpet anemones come in sandy shades of brown to greens, blues, and purple, and are hosts to seven different clownfish species.

                    Saddle carpet anemones can be easily differentiated from other anemones with their short, bulbous and sticky tentacles. They have a large oral disc with folds that are somewhat closely spaced, which can give it a wavy carpet appearance.
                    
                    They have stinging cells that line their tentacles and are carnivorous like many other sea anemones, feeding on various invertebrates and capture food particles that are suspended in water for ingestion.
                    
                    This species is mostly found singly on reefs and soft sandy bottoms and often rooting themselves into the substrate, they usually do not move around but have the capability to.

                <p>One of the most elegant types of coral reef species, is the gorgonian sea fan. Found predominantly in the Bahamas and the West Indies, this beautiful soft coral is made up of an intricate network of branchlets which grow from a small base.

                    The gorgonian sea fan coral comes in shades of off-white, yellow and lavender and is famously home to the pygmy seahorse, who live their entire adult lives attached to this delicately branched coral.
                    
                    Their preferred habitat is shallow waters with strong waves at a maximum depth of 10 metres, making them a coral reef species that can be enjoyed by both snorkelers and divers alike.
