                Despite their immense value, coral reefs face numerous threats that jeopardize their existence.
                Understanding these threats is essential in formulating effective strategies for their conservation.

                <p>Climate change poses one of the most significant threats to coral reefs. Rising sea temperatures,
                    
                    caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, can trigger coral bleaching events. When corals experience stress,
                    
                    they expel the vibrant algae residing within their tissues, leaving them pale and vulnerable to disease. Without the algae, corals lose their primary food source and become more susceptible to death.

                    In addition to coral bleaching, climate change also affects the growth and development of coral reefs. As carbon dioxide levels rise in the ocean,
                    
                    the process of calcification, which is crucial for building coral skeletons, becomes more difficult. This can lead to weaker and more fragile coral structures,
                    
                    making them more susceptible to physical damage from storms and wave action.
                    
                    The increasing frequency and severity of coral bleaching events are a testament to the urgent need for action on climate change.
                    
                    By reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to cleaner energy sources, we can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on coral reef ecosystems.

                <p>Another major threat to coral reefs is pollution, which comes from a variety of sources such as sewage, sedimentation, and chemical runoff.
                    
                    These pollutants can disrupt the delicate balance of coral reef ecosystems, leading to coral mortality and reduced biodiversity.
                    
                    Sedimentation, for example, can smother coral polyps and prevent them from receiving sufficient light for photosynthesis.
                    
                    Chemical pollutants, on the other hand, can damage coral tissues and inhibit their growth and reproduction.

                    In addition to direct pollution, nutrient runoff from agricultural activities can also have detrimental effects on coral reefs.
                    
                    Excessive nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can promote the growth of harmful algae, which can outcompete corals for space and resources.
                    
                    This process, known as eutrophication, can lead to the decline of coral populations and the loss of important reef-building species.
