                    The oceans and seas are incredible things of beauty, with a fascinating mix of underwater gardens and marine life.
                    Of particular importance are the stunning coral reefs, which act as a protection mechanism to coastlines and a home

                    <p>Not only is Australia's Great Barrier Reef one of the most beautiful reefs in the world,
                        but it's also the largest one on Earth. The reef comprises over 3,000 individual reef systems,
                        complete with abundant colorful marine life and 400 types of coral.
                        Situated off the coast of Queensland, the reef also features hundreds of islands,
                        many of which have pristine beaches that locals and tourists alike flock to every year.
                        One of the Seven Natural Wonders of World, the Great Barrier Reef is also a <abbr title="The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> World Heritage Site.

                    <p>The Red Sea Coral Reef is an amazing undersea world located in between two of the hottest and most arid
                        deserts in the world: the Sahara and the Arabian. Approximately 1,200 miles long, this reef,
                        which is over 5,000 years old, is home to 300 hard coral species and about 1,200 fish, of which 10 percent
                        are found only in this area. One thing to note about this coral reef is that it is strong,
                        able to withstand a variety of elements including extreme temperature changes.
