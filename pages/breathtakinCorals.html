                    <p>Not only is Australia's Great Barrier Reef one of the most beautiful reefs in the world,
                        but it's also the largest one on Earth. The reef comprises over 3,000 individual reef systems,
                        complete with abundant colorful marine life and 400 types of coral.
                        Situated off the coast of Queensland, the reef also features hundreds of islands,
                        many of which have pristine beaches that locals and tourists alike flock to every year.
                        One of the Seven Natural Wonders of World, the Great Barrier Reef is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                    <p>The second-largest double barrier reef in the world, the UNESCO World Heritage Site New Caledonia
                        Barrier Reef is an example of Mother Nature at her finest, complete with incredible blue waters
                        in varying shades. Located in the South Pacific off the northeast coast of Australia,
                        this double-barrier reef is home to a variety of marine life, many of which are still in the process
                        of being discovered and classified, with the Green turtle and 1,000 fish species already documented.
                        As with most of the stunning habitats, this one is constantly under threat due to man-made causes.
